# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements a neural network to classify breast cancer as **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques for effective and accurate classification of breast cancer cases.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes standardization and handling of the dataset.
- **Neural Network Model**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy and loss visualization.
- **Prediction System**: Allows predictions for new input data.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset provided by Scikit-learn. It contains features derived from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Results
- The model achieves a high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying breast cancer cases.
- Visualization of training metrics helps in understanding model performance.
